In the United States in 1920 there were 5,253,695 women of Negro descent;
over twelve hundred thousand of these were children, another twelve
hundred thousand were girls and young women under twenty, and two and a
half million were adults. As a mass these women have but the beginnings
of education,—twelve percent of those from sixteen to twenty years of
age were unable to write, and twenty-eight percent of those twenty-one
years of age and over. These women are passing through, not only a moral,
but an[260] economic revolution. Their grandmothers married at twelve
and fifteen, but in 1910 twenty-seven percent of these women who had
passed fifteen were still single.

Yet these black women toil and toil hard. There were in 1910 two and
a half million Negro homes in the United States. Out of these homes
walked daily to work two million women and girls over ten years of
age,—one half of the colored female population as against a fifth in
the case of white women. These, then, are a group of workers, fighting
for their daily bread like men; independent and approaching economic
freedom! They furnished a million farm laborers, 80,000 farmers, 22,000
teachers, 600,000 servants and washerwomen, and 50,000 in trades and
merchandizing. In 1920, 38.9% of colored women were at work as contrasted
with 17.2% of native white women. Of the colored women 39% were farming
and 50% in service.
