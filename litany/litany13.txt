Behold this maimed and broken thing; dear God it was a humble black man and sweat to save a bit from the pittance paid him. They told him: Work and Rise. He worked. Did this man sin? Nay but some one told how some on said another didâ€”one who he had never seen or known. Yet for this man's crime this man laid maimed and murdered, his wife naked in shame, his children, to poverty and evil.
