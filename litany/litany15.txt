Bewildered are we, and passion-tost, mad with the madness of
a mobbed and mocked and murdered people; straining at the 
armposts of Thy Throne, we raise our shckaed hands and charge Thee, God,
by the bones of our stolen fathers, by the tears of our dead mothers,
by the very blood of Thy crucified Christ; What meaneth this? Tell us
the Plan; give us the Sign!
