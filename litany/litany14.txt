Doth not this justice of hell stink in Thy nostrils, O God?
How long shall the mounting flood of innocent blood roar in
Thine ears and pound our hearts to vengeance? Pile the pale frenzy
of blood-crazed brutes who do such deed high on Thine altar,
Jehovah Jireh, and burn it in hell forever and forever!
